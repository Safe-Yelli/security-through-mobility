# Security *through* mobility, not just *in* mobility


## Important directions, ideas
- Women face a lot of issues with accessibility through the lens of safety on roads. [^3]
    - SafeYelli [^4] has been documenting it for over a year. So have SafeCity [^5], SafetyPin [^6] and other solutions
- Safety and access to **public spaces in the city are negotiated for accessibility to the self by women** [^7]
- **Crime Prevention Through Environment Design** (CPTED) is something that can be used to redesign bustands as safety islands as opposed to the City's initative to build safety islands  [^1]
- **Constant life and movement** should be encouraged by **mixed activites.** Bus Stands in India are already full of mixed activites, but can it be **formally encouraged**? [^2]
- **Feeder busses would encourage constant activity**. [Need Citation]

## What is needed? 
- An open dataset of **bus stands, lighting conditions, sidewalk conditions, standards conformity** [^10] for which SafetiPin and SafeYelli are developing tools. 
    - SafetiPin has developed a mature relationship with cities and administrations and has a mature dataset.
    - But the contestation here is that the **dataset is not seemingly open or contributable to.** The methodology is also less than ideal considering, we need more granularity and simplicity for the tools meant for crowdsourcing.
- A data visualisation to **realise the areas that are not covered by existing bus routes and would be helped by feeder busses. A system?** 

## A possibilites moodboard 

### Network analysis, visualisation, voronoi diagrams of bus stands and densities
